Linearly Combining Biomarkers by Direct Maximizing of Net Benefit

This repository has the in progress R code for the direct maximization of net benefit method proposed by Mishra et al (2019), which will be available through the University of Washington- Departmet of Biostatistics Department online dissertation repository shortly.   

The purpose of this code is to estimate linear combinations of risk markers (to produce a risk score) by directly maximizing the quantity standardized net benefit. This is a measure of clinical utility for risk score that predicts a binary outcome.

SNB = TPR - (C/B) * (1-P(Outcome))/P(Outcome) * FPR
